# HoneyPress - WordPress honeypot
WordPress honeypot in a docker container


## Update:
I have began a complete re-write / re-implementation of this idea. Decided it would be best to go with good ol' Flask and python for creating a "WordPress" install. Because of Flask's flexibility and Python's modularity there are all kinds of fun to be had.


## Clone and build Docker image
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sciking/HoneyPress.git
$ cd HoneyPress && docker build --rm -t honeypress .
```


## Start HoneyPress
```
$ docker run -d --name HoneyPress -p 80:80
```


## Logs
You can view access logs easily:
```
$ docker exec honeypress bash -c 'tail /opt/honeypress/logs/access.log'

### Password logging
If you wanted to extract a list of passwords used in testing:
```
$ docker exec honeypress bash -c 'tail /opt/honeypress/logs/auth.log'

## ToDo
- Log shipping (prolly will just use rsyslog / S3)
- Bake in notifications (SMS & email)
- Capture *all* POST/GET payload data into a log to be looked at later by an analyst.
- Figure out a way to introduce fake **MySQL** for SQLi analysis and payload capture
- TCP dump analysis
- Access log monitoring (look for things like sql injections, LFI/RFI, XSS, etc)
- Modular vulnerabilities. Need to make it easier to fake a new vulnerability so scanners think they're exploiting a live target
- Tor detection
- Database of some sort.. haven't decided if I should go with MongoDB or just use sqlite. Not sure about performance yet.
- Do some benchmarking.. is nginx needed?
- Some gangster-ish browser fingerprinting (that supports Tor browsers too)
- SLAP SOME GRAPHS ON THIS SHIT
